                        Question #1
When I decided to use the "If" statements it was because I needed some certain code
to run based on a certain condition such as if the user chose a certain option out of four choices.
This function is very useful for games that involve making choices throughout the game.
Now for, 'for' loops I used them when I wanted some certain code to be run a certain number of times,
or to be run until a certain condition occurs such as winning the game or a game over occurs.
A classic game for function to be used would be 20 questions. Keep asking questions and questions
and guessing whatever it may be and stops running when it has been guessed or the number of
questions has reached its limit of 20 questions.


                        Question #2

                        Question #3
By running the code and testing the code my self during the process of making the code.
There is a long cycle of testing the code I have made to see if it does what I expect.
If the code was not working right the first thing I always check is if the code is all spelled correctly
especially when the code is calling another function. After checking if things were spelled correctly
I would then look to make sure everything was indented correctly based off of the examples
we were given to create our code. If I still could not find the problem, I would
begin a trial and error of small details such as where stuff was indented.

                        Question #4
Algorithms are stuck operating based on their code, and they can not make adjustments or
free choices outside their code. We can't just evaluate students based on tests scores because
some students may be horrible test takers or good at guessing and others students might be horrible
at those.
